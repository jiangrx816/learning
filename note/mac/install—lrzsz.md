osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to version' > /dev/null 2>&1 && NAME=iTerm2 || NAME=iTerm
if [[ $NAME = "iTerm" ]]; then
    FILE=`osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm" to activate' -e 'tell application "iTerm" to set thefile to choose file with prompt "Choose a file to send"' -e "do shell script (\"echo \"&(quoted form of POSIX path of thefile as Unicode text)&\"\")"`

if [[ $FILE = "" ]]; then
    echo Cancelled.
    # Send ZModem cancel
    echo -e \\x18\\x18\\x18\\x18\\x18
    sleep 1
    echo
    echo \# Cancelled transfer

osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to version' > /dev/null 2>&1 && NAME=iTerm2 || NAME=iTerm

    FILE=`osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm" to activate' -e 'tell application "iTerm" to set thefile to choose folder with prompt "Choose a folder to place received files in"' -e "do shell script (\"echo \"&(quoted form of POSIX path of thefile as Unicode text)&\"\")"`

fi
```

# 三、配置
打开 iterm2 配置，选到 "Profiles" -> "Advanced" -> "edit", 添加一下两条:
```bash
Regular expression:  **B0100              Action: Run Silent Coprocess    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/iterm2-send-zmodem.sh
Regular expression:  **B00000000000000    Action: Run Silent Coprocess    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/iterm2-recv-zmodem.sh
```

# 四、软链
```bash
# 查看 sz、rz 安装位置
which sz
/opt/homebrew/bin/sz

# 软链
ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/sz /usr/local/bin
ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/rz /usr/local/bin

# 查看软链
ls -l /usr/local/bin | grep rz
ls -l /usr/local/bin | grep sz
```

# 五、使用
```bash
## 上传
rz -be 

## 下载 
sz filename
```
